## My work in meta-omics analyses

If you have interest in my work, is likely you work with meta-omics, the study of the collection of either genomes, transcriptomes or proteomes of a microbial community.

This presentation describes the tools I have developed for meta-omics analyses.

### UPIMAPI, reCOGnizer and KEGGCharter

[UPIMAPI](https://github.com/iquasere/UPIMAPI), [reCOGnizer](https://github.com/iquasere/reCOGnizer) and [KEGGCharter](https://github.com/iquasere/KEGGCharter) are tools developed for the analyses of omics data, and optimized for handling the challenges of meta-omics.
