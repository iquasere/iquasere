## Tools for meta-omics analyses

My work has mostly been the development of tools for analyses of meta-omics data, i.e., the study of the collective genomes, transcriptomes or proteomes of a microbial community.

These are the main tools I have developed for meta-omics analyses:

### UPIMAPI, reCOGnizer and KEGGCharter

[UPIMAPI](https://github.com/iquasere/UPIMAPI), [reCOGnizer](https://github.com/iquasere/reCOGnizer) and [KEGGCharter](https://github.com/iquasere/KEGGCharter) are tools developed for the analyses of omics data, and optimized for handling the challenges of meta-omics.

### MOSCA

[MOSCA](https://github.com/iquasere/MOSCA) is a powerful pipeline developed for metagenomics (MG), metatranscriptomics (MT) and metaproteomics (MP) integrated analyses.
